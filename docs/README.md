# Contributing to KubeVela Docs

[Here](https://github.com/oam-dev/kubevela/tree/master/docs) is the source documentation of [Kubevela website](http://kubevela.io/).
Any files modifid here will trigger the `check-docs` Github action to run and validate the docs could be build successfully into the website.
Any changes on these files(`docs/en/*`, `docs/en/resource/*`, `sidebars.js`) will be submitted to the corresponding locations of the repo 
[kubevela.io](https://github.com/oam-dev/kubevela.io). The Github-Action there will parse the document and publish it to the Kubevela Website automatically.

Please follow our guides below to learn how to write the docs in the right way.

## Add or Update Docs

When you add or modify the docs, these three files(`docs/en/`, `docs/en/resource/` and `sidebars.js`) should be taken into consideration.

1. `docs/en/`, the main English documentation files are mainly located in this folder. All markdown files need to follow the format,
   that the title at the beginning should be in the following format:
   
    ```markdown
    ---
    title: Title Name
    ---

    ```

   When you want to add a link refer to any `.md` files inside the docs(`docs/en`), you need to use relative path and remove the `.md` suffix.
   For example, the `en/helm/component.md` has a link refer to `en/platform-engineers/definition-and-templates.md`. Then the format should like:
   
    ```markdown
    [the definition and template concepts](../platform-engineers/definition-and-templates)
    ```
   
2. `docs/en/resource/`, image files are located in this folder. When you want to use link any image in documentation, 
   you should put the image resources here and use a relative path like below:
  
   ```markdown
    ![alt](./resources/concepts.png)
    ```

3. `sidebars.js`, this file contain the navigation information of the KubeVela website.
    Please read [the official docs of docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar) to learn how to write `sidebar.js`.
    
    ```js
       {
          type: 'category',
          label: 'Capability References',
          items: [
            // Note!: here must be add the path under "docs/en" 
            'developers/references/README',
            'developers/references/workload-types/webservice',
            'developers/references/workload-types/task',
            ...
          ],
        },
    ```

## Local Development

You can preview the website locally with the `node` and `yarn` installed.
Every time you modify the files under the docs, you need to re-run the following command, it will not sync automatically:

```shell
make docs-start
```

## Build in Local

You can build Kubevela website in local to test the correctness of docs, only run the following cmd:

```shell
make docs-build

```
