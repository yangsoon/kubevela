# KubeVela

KubeVela is the platform engine to create *PaaS-like* experience on Kubernetes, in a scalable approach.

## Community

- Slack:  [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/) #kubevela channel
- Gitter: [Discussion](https://gitter.im/oam-dev/community)
- Bi-weekly Community Call: [Meeting Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nqdFEyULekyksFHtFvgvFAYE-0AMHKoS3RMnaKsarjs)

> NOTE: KubeVela is still iterating quickly. It's currently under pre-beta release.

## What problems does it solve?

Building **developer-centric platforms** with Kubernetes requires higher level primitives which is out-of-scope of Kubernetes itself. Hence, we platform teams build abstractions.

However, great in flexibility and extensibility, the existing solutions such as IaC (Infrastructure-as-Code) and client-side templating tools all lead to ***Configuration Drift*** (i.e. the generated instances are not in line with the expected configuration) which is a nightmare in production.

KubeVela allows platform teams to create developer-centric abstractions with IaC but maintain them with the battle tested [Kubernetes Control Loop](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/). Think about a plug-in that turns your Kubernetes cluster into a *"PaaS"* via abstractions designed by yourself.

## Getting Started

- [Installation](https://kubevela.io/docs/install)
- [Quick start](https://kubevela.io/docs/quick-start)
- [How it works](https://kubevela.io/docs/concepts)

## Features

- **Robust, repeatable and extensible approach to create and maintain abstractions** - design your abstractions with [CUE](https://cuelang.org/) or [Helm](https://helm.sh), ship them to end users by `kubectl apply -f`, automatically generating GUI forms, upgrade your abstractions at runtime, and let Kubernetes controller guarantee determinism of the abstractions, no configuration drift.
- **Generic progressive rollout framework** - built-in rollout framework and strategies to upgrade your microservice regardless of its workload type (e.g. stateless, stateful, or even custom operators etc), seamless integration with observability systems.
- **Multi-enviroment app delievry model (WIP)** - built-in model to deliver or rollout your apps across multiple enviroments and/or clusters, seamless integration with Service Mesh for traffic management. 
- **Simple and Kubernetes native** - KubeVela is just a simple custom controller, all its app delivery abstractions and features are defined as [Kubernetes Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) so they naturally work with any CI/CD or GitOps tools.
